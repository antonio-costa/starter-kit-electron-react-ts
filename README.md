# Starter kit Electron React Typescript

This is a started project with the following characteristics:

- Electron
  - Context Bridge already setup
- React
- Typescript
- ESLint
- Webpack + Webpack dev server
- Electron Builder
- Sass Loader
- Module is commonjs (instead of esnext in create-react-app)
- NPM scripts are **windows specific**

## Motivation

This project was started in order to:

1. Get to know how Webpack/Electron/React/Babel/... works
2. Gain control over the pre-configurations

CRA uses hidden configurations for simplicity, which most of the times work without issues.  
However, sometimes webpack needs to be tweaked but since CRA hides this configuration, it needs to be ejected. Instead of ejecting my project, I was motivated to learn how to start one on my own.
